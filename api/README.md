cobalt api code is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE).

this license allows you to modify, distribute and use the code for any purpose
as long as you:
- give appropriate credit to the original repo when using or modifying any parts of the code,
- provide a link to the license and indicate if changes to the code were made, and

## running your own instance
if you want to run your own instance for whatever purpose, [follow this guide](/docs/run-an-instance.md).
it's *highly* recommended to use a docker compose method unless you run for developing/debugging purposes.

## accessing the api
currently, there is no publicly accessible main api. we plan on providing a public api for
cobalt 10 in some form in the future. we recommend deploying your own instance if you wish
to use the latest api. you can access [the documentation](/docs/api.md) for it here.

if you are looking for the documentation for the old (7.x) api, you can find
it [here](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/blob/7/docs/api.md)
