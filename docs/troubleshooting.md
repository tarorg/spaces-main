## how to fix clipboard pasting in older versions of firefox
```
üéâ firefox finally supports pasting by default starting from version 125.

üëç you don't need to follow this tutorial if you're on the latest version of firefox.
```
you can fix this issue by changing a single preference in `about:config`.

### steps to enable clipboard functionality
1. go to `about:config`:  
   ![screenshot showing about:config entered into address bar](images/troubleshooting/clipboard/config.png)  

2. if asked, read what firefox has to say and press "accept the risk and continue".  
 ‚ö† tinkering with other preferences may break your browser. **do not** edit them unless you know what you're doing.   

   ![screenshot showing about:config security warning that reads: "proceed with caution. changing advanced configuration preferences can impact firefox performance or security." lower there's a pre-checked checkbox that says: "warn me when i attempt to access these preferences". lowest element is a blue button that says "accept the risk and continue"](images/troubleshooting/clipboard/risk.png)  

3. search for `dom.events.asyncClipboard.readText`
